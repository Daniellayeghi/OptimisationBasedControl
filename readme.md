# Overview

This repo is primarily based on implementation of trajectory optimisation algorithms. The two main algorithms implemented atm are iLQR and MPPI.
The **app** directory has the source files for both algorithms running on environments such as cartpole, acrobot, double integrator in the context of an MPC loop.
